Description: The program should read in a file of state capitals, then quiz the 
user on the capitals of 10 randomly selected states. The user should be given 4 possible 
answers for each question, and the program should keep track of the user's score. The main file 
should loop 10 times, asking a question each time, and then record and display the user's final score at the end.
